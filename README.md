# DRML
Welcome to DRML, the DRM Library! Here you'll find my various research, notes, and random information about various kinds of DRM, and DRM tangential information.

This library is made in tandem with my work on [BurnOutSharp](https://github.com/mnadareski/BurnOutSharp), which is where the more exact details of how these DRMs can be detected will continue to be found.
