### Overall Description:

Roxxe was a Czech CD copy protection, with the official website being available in both English and Czech.[^Roxxe_Website_2001] It claims to work using a physical key on the CD-ROM that is not reproducible.[^Roxxe_English_Landing_2001] Due to the lack of samples and documentation, it's not known what this physical key would have been.
